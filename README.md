# Easy
This repository exists to store my entry into the 12th annual Society of Actuaries Speculative Fiction contest.

If you want to read it (and offer comments!), download Easy.pdf. I have also added Easy.txt, if for whatever reason you cannot read the PDF.

## UPDATE 20161227
On 21 December 2016 I submitted the final version - the version you see here - to the contest.
